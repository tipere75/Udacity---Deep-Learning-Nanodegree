# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree

This repository contains the projects I realized while completing the Deep Learning Nanodegree from Udacity.  

## Projects list  
1. First neural network : <a href="https://github.com/tipere75/Udacity---Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%201%20-%20Bike%20sharing%20patterns">Bike sharing patterns<\a>  
I build a mutli-layer neural network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.  
2. CNN models for image classification : <a href="https://github.com/tipere75/Udacity---Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%202%20-%20Dog%20breed%20classifier">Dog breed classifier<\a>  
I build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine's breed. Given an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
3. RNN & LSTM models : <a href="https://github.com/tipere75/Udacity---Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%203%20-%20TV%20scripts%20generation">Sentiment analysis and generate tv scripts<\a>  
4. DCGAN models : <a href="https://github.com/tipere75/Udacity---Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%204%20-%20Face%20generation">Generate faces<\a>  
I build a pair of multi-layer neural networks and made them compete against each other in order to generate realistic faces.  
5. Deploying a model with Amazon SageMaker : <a href="https://github.com/tipere75/Udacity---Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%205%20-%20Sentiment%20analysis%20model">Deploying a sentiment analysis model<\a>
