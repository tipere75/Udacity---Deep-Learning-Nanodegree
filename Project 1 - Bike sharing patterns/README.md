# DLND--Project-Bike-Sharing-Pattern
In this project, I build and trained a neural network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.


## List of files  
- Your_first_neural_network.ipynb : jupyter notebook containing the data preparation, the training of the network and the analyzis of the output  
- Your_first_neural_network.html : same file in a html format  
- my_answers.py : definition of the network from scratch  
- requirements.txt : packages required for the project  
- setup.sh : how to use the udacity assistant to validate the quality of the network  
- jwt : the reference to be used by the udacity assitant for its validation  
- first_neural_network-279832.zip : file submitted with the network and the udacity assistant analysis  
- first_neural_network-279832.json : same file in a json format
