# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree

This repository contains the projects I realized while completing the Deep Learning Nanodegree from Udacity.  

## Projects list  
1. First neural network : Bike sharing patterns  
I build a mutli-layer neural network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.  
2. CNN models for image classification : Dog breed classifier  
I build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine's breed. Given an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
3. RNN & LSTM models : Sentiment analysis and generate tv scripts  
4. DCGAN models : Generate faces  
I build a pair of multi-layer neural networks and made them compete against each other in order to generate realistic faces.  
5. Reinforcement learning : Train a quadcopter to fly  
I designed an agent that can fly a quadcopter. Then I trained it using a reinforcement learning algorithm.
